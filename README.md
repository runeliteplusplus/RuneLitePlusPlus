# RuneLitePlusPlus


## What is RuneLitePlusPlus?

RuneLitePlusPlus is an alternative to the traditional Runelite client that offers an enhanced plugin suite and features many "forbidden" or "against the rules" plugins Jagex has asked Runelite to remove from their official client.

RuneLitePlusPlus is kept up to date with the latest Runelite version so none of our plugins go out of date or become depracted.

All of our additional plugins do nothing more then provide graphical overlays, this is not detectable or bannable and you do not have any extra risk in using our client opposed to the official.


## How do I use this amazing client?

If you're tech savvy, you can download the official runelite client source and simply drag and drop our plugins into the plugins folder before building and you will get the same exact .jar file that we offer.

Alternatively, you may simply download the provided .jar file and run it, it will automatically launch RuneLitePlusPlus.

Please note when running .jar files for your client (instead of the typical .exe) there will be no update checking, so if there is an update to the official Runelite client you should manually come back here and download the latest version.


## How do I know the .jar you provide is safe?

The .jar file we provide is always vanilla Runelite compiled with our additonal plugins. You can verify authenticity by manually building the .jar and comparing MD5 hashes.

The current MD5 hash of client-1.5.4-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar: b1ef39de3b3a2934878a3f9739f4f0f1

If you build runelite with our open source plugins and get any other result, **DO NOT DOWNLOAD AND RUN OUR .JAR!!!**
